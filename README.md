# FrankFlix-App
This is the Frontend Clone of the popular Netflix App. Link to the deployed site: https://frankflix-project.web.app/

# Description
The Flix site is the frontend clone of the Netflix site. It allows users' Authentication (Email and Password) through Firebase, hence, users can Sign-Up, Log In and Log Out of the site. Users' details are stored in the cloud firestore database. Users can also view their account by clicking the Account Link. The movies were called through the movieDb API, gotten through their site.
Movies are displayed in four categories: Up Coming, Popular, Trending and Top Rated.

# Tools Used
React - Flix was designed with the create-react-app as the development Library.
Firebase - Firebase was used for authentication and served as the database for user's details.
TailwindCss - All the styling was done using tailwind. I highly recommend it for any development project.
Tailwind-scrollbar-hide - This dependency was installed independent of the tailwind css dependency. It is responsible for scrolling through the generted movies,
Axios - The API was called using Axios
React-Router-Dom - Integrated to allow navigation acrooss pages
React-icons - All icons were generated throught the react icon

# Challenges
None, I have no regrets doing this.

# Recommendation
I would highly recommend for any developer trying to explore Firebase.
